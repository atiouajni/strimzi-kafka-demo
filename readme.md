# Introduction
This repository contains manifests and sources to be able to operate Kafka cluster and build Kafka clients.

I used Strimzi to operate Kafka cluster. 

**1 - Deploy a Kafka cluster with Strimzi Operators**

You can find more details about how Strimzi simplify Kafka operational tasks in my [blog](https://anissetiouajni.com/posts/simplify-kafka-operational-tasks-with-strimzi-and-kubernetes)

**2 - Accessing to a secure Kafka cluster from Spring Boot applications**

You can find [here](https://anissetiouajni.com/posts/accessing_a_secure_apache_kafka_managed_by_strimzi_from_quarkus/) how I create a Kafka producer and consumer based on Spring Boot framework to access a secure Kafka cluster.
